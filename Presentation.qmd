## My Path to Data Science {.smaller}
- Graduated from Willamette in 2020 with a degree in Economics
- Always loved to code and during the early stages of the pandemic began taking online classes
- Fell in love with data and wanted to explore what I could do with it
- Worked for a year at a small cosmetics start up as a production assistant. My job encompassed many other roles including data analysis of our products within the cosmetics ecosystem and our supply chain data systems
- Began the Masters of Data Science program in the summer of 2022; will graduate in August of 2023
- Within the program I have used my own hobbies and passions to seek out interesting data sets to analyze and visualize in ways that my non-data peers can understand and enjoy
