## My Path to Data Science 

- I graduated from Willamette in 2020 with a degree in Economics. 
- Always loved to code and during the early stages of the pandemic began taking online classes 
- Fell in love with data and wanted to explore what I could do with it 
- Worked for a year at a small cosmetic start up as a production assistant. My job encompassed many other roles including data analysis of the products cosmetic ecosystem and our supply chain data systems. 
- Began the data science masters program in the summer of 2022. Will be graduating in August of 2023. 
- Within the program I have used my own hobbys and passions to seek out interesting data sets and analyze and visualize them in ways that my non data peers can understand and enjoy.
